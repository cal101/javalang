	<p>This package contains a Java 1.7 Parser with AST (Abstract
		Syntax Tree) generation and visitor support. The AST records the
		source code structure, javadoc and comments.</p>
	<p>
		This parser is based on Sreenivasa Viswanadha's Java 1.5 parser. The
		project was originally hosted at <a
			href="http://code.google.com/p/javaparser/">http://code.google.com/p/javaparser/</a>
		but seemed dead. This repository at <a
			href="https://github.com/rpau/javalang">https://github.com/rpau/javalang</a>
		keeps the code alive for <a href="http://www.walkmod.com"
			target="_blank">walkmod</a> because it is modified according the <a
			href="http://www.walkmod.com" target="_blank">walkmod</a> needs.
	</p>
	<p>Javadoc texts can be also parseable to process Javadoc tags.</p>
	<p>The Java AST nodes can be merged to simplify code
		transformations, using a semantic merge engine.</p>
