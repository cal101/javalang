This package contains a Java 1.7 Parser with AST generation and visitor support. 
The AST records the source code structure, javadoc and comments.

This parser is based on Sreenivasa Viswanadha's Java 1.5 parser.

The project was originally hosted at http://code.google.com/p/javaparser/ but 
seemed dead. This repository adds powerful parsing functionalities for http://www.walkmod.com/ such 
as AST merge support or Javadoc parsing.
